# cDisguise
This is a custom disguise plugin that hooks into AquaCore for rank selection, and will disguise the user as a random player. This plugin also syncs across bungee servers.

## Can I use this for my own projects?
You can use this plugin in a non-commercial enviroment without asking me. However, for any other purpose you must request my permission.
